Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is valuable for various applications. It combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to perform tasks like text analysis, translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

Key Components of NLP:
Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or phrases.
Syntax and Parsing: Analyzing sentence structure and grammar.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying names of people, places, organizations, etc.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of text.
Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined labels.
Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.

This repository contains projects and resources for the study of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on techniques and tools for working with text and language data. The topics covered range from text preprocessing and tokenization to advanced methods in machine learning and deep learning for NLP tasks.
